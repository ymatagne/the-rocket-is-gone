  <h2>Container - LXC</h2>
  <h3>Our main focus is system containers. That is, containers which offer an <span id="wold">environment</span> as <span id="wold">close as possible</span> as the one you'd get from a <span id="wold">VM</span> but <span id="wold">without the overhead</span> that comes with running a <span id="wold">separate kernel</span> and <span id="wold">simulating</span> all the hardware.</h3>
